"""Given a square matrix[][] of size N x N. The task is to rotate it by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.

Input:
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case consists of an integer N, where N is the size of the square matrix. The second line of each test case contains N x N space-separated values of the matrix.

Output:
Corresponding to each test case, in a new line, print the rotated array.

Your Task:
You only need to implement the given function rotate(). Do not read input, instead use the arguments given in the function.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 50
1 <= matrix[][] <= 100

Example:
Input:
1
3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Output:
3 6 9
2 5 8
1 4 7
