In information theory, linguistics and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the
difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of
single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
It is named after the Soviet mathematician Vladimir Levenshtein, who considered this distance in 1965.[1]

Levenshtein distance may also be referred to as edit distance, although that term may also denote a larger family of
distance metrics known collectively as edit distance.[2]:32 It is closely related to pairwise string alignments.
