## Purpose:
I have created this repository to assemble all Python problems that I have solved from <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeeksForGeeks</a>
Mostly all questions are asked in Amazon Coding interview.

Also, I am solving problems from ProjectEuler+ from <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges">HackerRank</a>
- All problems will be well named and categorised for easy readability and access.

## Activity:
I update the repository 2 times a week.

## Contribution:
You can contribute to my repository and give a pull request. I will accept your contribution and merge the Python code files.
